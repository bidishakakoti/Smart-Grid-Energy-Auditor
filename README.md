## Overview

Modern households waste energy due to inefficient appliances (low power factor) and lack of real-time load management — leading to tripped breakers and inflated bills.

**Smart Grid Energy Auditor** acts as an intelligent software layer over a simulated home electrical system. It monitors live load, audits appliance efficiency, and computes dynamic billing — all from a clean console dashboard.

This is a **university OOP project** written in **C++17**, designed to demonstrate core and advanced Object-Oriented Programming principles in a realistic, practical context.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| ⚡ **Live Grid Dashboard** | Real-time console view of all appliance loads vs. safety capacity |
| 🔴 **Safety Load Management** | Warns and flags when total wattage exceeds the grid limit (default: 5000W) |
| 🔍 **Efficiency Auditing** | Detects inductive loads (ACs, motors) with poor Power Factor (PF < 0.85) and recommends capacitor correction |
| 💰 **Tiered Dynamic Billing** | Calculates costs using standard vs. peak-hour rates via overloaded functions |
| 💾 **Persistent Logging** | Saves audit reports and session summaries to files via RAII destructors |
| 🔄 **Appliance State Tracking** | Each appliance can be in `ON`, `OFF`, or `STANDBY` state |

## OOP Concepts Demonstrated

This project is structured to showcase each major C++ OOP concept explicitly:

### 1. 🔒 Encapsulation
Raw `voltage`, `current`, and `powerFactor` are stored as `private` members in the `Appliance` base class. No derived class or external code can accidentally corrupt these values — they are only accessible through controlled interfaces.

### 2. 🧬 Inheritance
```
Appliance  (Abstract Base Class)
├── ResistiveLoad    → Heaters, Bulbs    (Load = V × I)
└── InductiveLoad    → ACs, Motors       (Load = V × I × PF)
```
Both derived classes inherit common properties (name, wattage, state) while implementing their own energy logic.

### 3. 🎭 Polymorphism
The `calculateLoad()` function is declared **pure virtual** in `Appliance`, forcing each derived class to provide its own implementation. A `GridController` holding a `vector<unique_ptr<Appliance>>` can call `calculateLoad()` on any appliance without knowing its type.

```cpp
// Same call, different behaviour depending on object type
for (auto& appliance : appliances) {
    totalLoad += appliance->calculateLoad(); // Polymorphic dispatch
}
```

### 4. ➕ Operator Overloading
The `+` operator is overloaded on `Appliance` to return the combined active wattage of two appliances — used by `GridController` to perform safety checks cleanly.

```cpp
float combined = ac + heater; // Returns sum of their active loads
```

### 5. 🤝 Friend Class
The `Auditor` class is declared a **friend** of `Appliance`. This grants it read-only access to private `powerFactor` data — without exposing a public getter that any code could call. This models the real-world concept of a privileged auditor having inspection rights.

```cpp
class Appliance {
    friend class Auditor; // Only Auditor can inspect private PF
private:
    float powerFactor;
};
```

### 6. 🏗️ Constructors & Destructors (RAII)
- **Constructors** initialize appliances with real-time energy prices loaded at startup.
- **Destructor** of `GridController` automatically saves the session summary to `data/session.txt` when the program exits — no explicit save call needed.

## System Workflow

```
Phase 1 — SETUP
  └── GridController loads appliances (Samsung AC, Water Heater, LED Bulbs...)
      Each constructed with name, wattage, voltage, current, power factor

Phase 2 — MONITORING  (Operator Overloading + Polymorphism)
  └── GridController sums load using overloaded + operator
      If Total Load > 5000W → Safety Warning triggered

Phase 3 — AUDITING    (Friend Class)
  └── Auditor reads private powerFactor of each InductiveLoad
      If PF < 0.85 → Logs recommendation: "Apply Capacitor Correction"
      Report saved to data/audit_logs.txt

Phase 4 — BILLING     (Function Overloading)
  └── BillingEngine::calculate(units)           → Standard rate
      BillingEngine::calculate(units, isPeak)   → Peak-hour surcharge applied

Phase 5 — EXIT        (RAII Destructor)
  └── GridController destructor fires automatically
      Daily summary written to data/session.txt
```
